# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS

This repository contains two files that provide information about different applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each file focuses on a specific use case and describes its context, techniques used, and potential benefits.

## Use-case 1: Text Classification Use Case

This use case involves the task of assigning emails to specific categories or folders based on their content. It falls under the category of text classification, which requires training a model to recognize patterns and make predictions about the appropriate folder for each email.

The main goal of this use case is to automate the process of organizing emails, saving time and effort for users. By employing NLP techniques, such as natural language understanding and predictive modeling, the application can accurately categorize emails based on their content.

## Use-case 2: Automated Essay Grading Use Case

The second use case focuses on automated essay grading, another application of NLP. This use case aims to analyze the content and quality of an essay question and provide a grade based on predefined criteria.

Using NLP algorithms and techniques, the application evaluates essays based on factors like grammar, coherence, and the incorporation of relevant information. By automating the grading process, this use case offers efficiency and consistency in evaluating a large number of essays.

## Use-case 3: Clinical Decision Support System Use Case

The third use case revolves around a clinical decision support system. This application assists doctors by analyzing patient responses to questions and providing probable diagnoses or recommendations based on that information.

By leveraging NLP, the system can process patient responses and extract valuable insights, such as identifying symptoms, assessing risk factors, and suggesting appropriate diagnoses or treatment options. This use case aims to enhance medical decision-making and improve patient care.
